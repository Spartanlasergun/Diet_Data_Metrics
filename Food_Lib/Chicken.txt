Chicken
:BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
Chicken in is a cheap and readily available meat. It is packed in a variety of formats, from whole roasting chickens to selections of one particular cut, such as thighs or wings.  }
Highly automated, large-scale chicken farming and processing complexes run by large corporations fuel the international chicken market. The development of so-called factory farming}
sharply reduced the price and increased the availability of chicken, when this method was introduced in the 1920s. The ancestor of today's domestic chicken is the wild red jungle  }
fowl Gallus gallus, native to India and Southeast Asia. The red jungle fowl was first domesticated apparently for use in religious rituals involving cockfighting. The domesticated }
bird spread west-ward from India to Greece, and was later introduced to Western Europe by invading Roman armies. By the Roman era, chickens were used as food, both for their meat  }
and for their eggs. Romans commonly carried them on their ships, as a convenient source of fresh food.                                                                              }
:DIETARY NOTICE:
Chicken is an excellent source of many nutrients, including protein, iron,    }
potassium, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, Vitamin B6, pantothenic acid and      }
Vitamin B12. It also contains significant amounts of calcium, magnesium,      }
Vitamin K, zinc, selenium, copper, phosphorus and choline.                    }
An excellent source of protein, a single pound of chicken contains 211% of    }
recommended daily values or 105.5 grams of protein. In addition, chicken is   }
also a source of complete protein, meaning it abundantly contains all 9       }
essential amino acids. The protein data in a single pound reflects the        }
following-                                                                    }

	Tryptophan - 0.89 g             Methionine - 2.7 g                        }
	Threonine - 4.4 g               Phenylalanine - 4.13 g                    }

	Leucine - 8.23 g                Histidine - 3.2 g                         }
Note- Like all meats, chicken contains cholesterol which should be manually   }
regulated in the diet to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease and high blood}
pressure.                                                                     }
