Green Tea
:BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
Green, black, and oolong teas all come from the same plant, Camellia sinensis, but are prepared using different methods. To produce green tea, leaves from the plant are steamed,   }
pan fried, and dried. Tea has been used for medicinal purposes in China and Japan for thousands of years. Green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement is promoted for improving   }
mental alertness, relieving digestive symptoms and headaches, and promoting weight loss. Green tea and its components, including epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), have been       }
studied for their possible protective effects against heart disease and cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a topical ointment, sinecatechins (brand   }
name Veregen), which includes extracted components of green tea leaves and is used for the treatment of genital warts. Although many studies have been done on green tea and its    }
extracts, definite conclusions cannot yet be reached on whether green tea is helpful for most of the purposes for which it is used; this includes its effectiveness against cancer, }
as well as cardiovascular disease.                                                                                                                                                  }
:DIETARY NOTICE:
Green tea, when consumed as a beverage, is believed to be safe when used in   }
amounts up to 8 cups per day. Keep in mind that only the amount of added      }
caffeine must be stated on product labels and not the caffeine that naturally }
occurs in green tea.                                                          }
Although uncommon, liver problems have been reported in a number of people who} 
took green tea products, primarily green tea extracts in pill form. People    }
with liver disease should consult a health care provider before taking        }
products with green tea extract. People taking green tea extracts, especially }
those with liver disease, should discontinue use and consult a health care    }
provider if they develop symptoms of liver trouble (such as abdominal pain,   }
dark urine, or jaundice).                                                     }
Green tea is an ingredient in many over-the-counter weight loss products,     }
some of which have been identified as the likely cause of rare cases of liver }
injury. Green tea at high doses has been shown to reduce blood levels and     }
therefore the effectiveness of the drug nadolol, a beta-blocker used for high }
blood pressure and heart problems. It may also interact with other medicines. }
