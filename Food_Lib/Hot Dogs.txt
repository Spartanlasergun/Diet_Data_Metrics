Hot Dogs(Chicken)
:BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
Hot dogs are a processed meat product made by mixing chopped meat with various curing ingredients, flavorants, and colorants. The meat is then stuffed in casings, cooked, removed  } 
from the casing, and put in the final package. Although the technology for hot dog making was developed thousands of years ago, these meat products continue to be a popular        }
summertime food. The typical raw hot dog is a pink, cylindrical-shaped piece of meat. It is about 1.6 oz (45.36 g) on average and contains anywhere from 0.175-0.245 oz (5-7 g) of  }
protein. It also contains about 0.455 oz (13 g) of fat, 450 mg of sodium and 150 calories. Since hot dogs are meat products, they contain small amounts of certain essential        }
nutrients including iron, zinc, niacin, riboflavin, and B vitamins. Since they are a pre-cooked food, they are less prone to spoilage than other types of meat products. This makes }
them one of the safest meat products available.                                                                                                                                     }     
:DIETARY NOTICE:
As with most meats, hot dogs do contain dietary cholesterol which is          }
associated with cardiovascular disease and high-blood pressure. It is         }
important to keep track of cholesterol, especially if your typical diet       }
includes lots of processed meats like hot dogs.                               }
Unprocessed meats such as chicken or beef are typically better sources of     }
protein per gram, when compared to processed meats like hot dogs.             }
