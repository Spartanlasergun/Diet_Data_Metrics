Ketchup
:BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
The tangy sauce originated in ancient China as a brine of pickled fish or shellfish called "ke-tsiap." Neighboring countries adopted their own variations of "kechap" consisting of } 
fish brine, herbs, and spices. In the late 1600s, English sailors visiting Malaysia and Singapore were so impressed with the sauce that they took samples home. English cooks       }
attempted to duplicate the spicy sauce, but without access to some of the exotic Asian ingredients, they improvised with cucumbers, mushrooms, nuts, oysters, and other variants.   }
One hundred years later, New Englanders created the definitive tomato ketchup when Maine seamen returned from Mexico and the Spanish West Indies with seeds of an exotic New World  }
fruit called tomato. The tangy tomato ketchup quickly became a popular sauce for codfish cakes, meat, and other foods. Ketchup became commercially available in the second half of  }
the 1800s. H.J. Heinz Co. developed one of the first leading brands of mass-marketed ketchup. The main ingredients of ketchup are tomatoes, sweeteners, vinegar, salt, spices,      }
flavorings, onion, and/or garlic. The types of sweetener used are usually granulated cane sugar or beet sugar. Other sweeteners include dextrose or liquid sugar in the form of     }
corn or glucose syrup. The spices commonly used to enhance the flavor of the tomatoes are allspice, cassia, cinnamon, cayenne, cloves, pepper, ginger, mustard, and paprika.        }
:DIETARY NOTICE:
Ketchup is not a significant source of any important dietary nutrient. It is  }
also very low in calories for the serving size. It contains small amounts of  }
sodium which makes it an excellent pairing with potato based foods that are   }
high in potassium. There are no strict guidelines concerning the use of       }
ketchup.                                                                      }
