Calcium
:BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is found in some foods, added to others, available as a dietary supplement, and present in some medicines (such as antacids).       }
Calcium is required for vascular contraction and vasodilation, muscle function, nerve transmission, intracellular signaling and hormonal secretion, though less than 1% of total    }
body calcium is needed to support these critical metabolic functions. Serum calcium is very tightly regulated and does not fluctuate with changes in dietary intakes; the body uses }
bone tissue as a reservoir for, and source of calcium, to maintain constant concentrations of calcium in blood, muscle, and intercellular fluids. The remaining 99% of the body’s   }
calcium supply is stored in the bones and teeth where it supports their structure and function. Bone itself undergoes continuous remodeling, with constant resorption and deposition}
of calcium into new bone. The balance between bone resorption and deposition changes with age. Bone formation exceeds resorption in periods of growth in children and adolescents,  }
whereas in early and middle adulthood both processes are relatively equal. In aging adults, particularly among postmenopausal women, bone breakdown exceeds formation, resulting in }
bone loss that increases the risk of osteoporosis over time.                                                                                                                        }
:CALCIUM DEFICIENCY:
Inadequate intakes of dietary calcium from food and supplements produce no    }
obvious symptoms in the short term. Circulating blood levels of calcium are   }
tightly regulated. Hypocalcemia results primarily from medical problems or    }
treatments, including renal failure, surgical removal of the stomach and      }
use of certain medications (such as diuretics). Symptoms of hypocalcemia      }
include numbness and tingling in the fingers, muscle cramps, convulsions,     }
lethargy, poor appetite, and abnormal heart rhythms. If left untreated,       }
calcium deficiency leads to death.                                            }
                                                                              }
Over the long term, inadequate calcium intake causes osteopenia which if      }
untreated can lead to osteoporosis. The risk of bone fractures also increases,}
especially in older individuals. Calcium deficiency can also cause rickets,   }
though it is more commonly associated with vitamin D deficiency.              }
