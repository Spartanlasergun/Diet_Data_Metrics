Chromium
:BACKGROUND INFORMATION:   
Chromium, as trivalent (+3) chromium, is a trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Chromium also exists as hexavalent (+6)     }
chromium, a toxic by-product of stainless steel and other manufacturing processes. Chromium might play a role in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism by potentiating insulin}
action. Although the precise mechanism for this activity has not been identified, scientists have proposed that chromium binds to an oligopeptide to form chromodulin, a            }
low-molecular-weight, chromium-binding substance that binds to and activates the insulin receptor to promote insulin action. Chromium might also have antioxidant effects.          }
:CHROMIUM DEFICIENCY:
In 2001, the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academies of      }
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine considered chromium to be an essential    }
nutrient based on its effects on insulin action. However, recent research     }
has suggested that although chromium might have benefits at pharmacologic     }
amounts (e.g., in the hundreds of mcg), it is not an essential mineral        }
because an absence or deficiency of chromium does not produce abnormalities   }
that can be reversed with the addition of chromium. Chromium deficiency has   }
not been reported in healthy populations, and no definitive deficiency        }
symptoms have been established.                                               }
