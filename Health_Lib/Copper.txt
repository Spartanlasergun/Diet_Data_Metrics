Copper
:BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
Copper, an essential mineral, is naturally present in some foods and is available as a dietary supplement. It is a cofactor for several enzymes (known as “cuproenzymes”) involved  }
in energy production, iron metabolism, neuropeptide activation, connective tissue synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis. One abundant cuproenzyme is ceruloplasmin (CP),        }
which plays a role in iron metabolism and carries more than 95% of the total copper in healthy human plasma. Copper is also involved in many physiologic processes, such as         }
angiogenesis; neurohormone homeostasis; and regulation of gene expression, brain development, pigmentation, and immune system functioning. In addition, defense against oxidative   }
damage depends mainly on the copper-containing superoxide dismutases. A wide variety of plant and animal foods contain copper, and the average human diet provides approximately    }
1,400 mcg/day for men and 1,100 mcg/day for women that is primarily absorbed in the upper small intestine. Almost two-thirds of the body’s copper is located in the skeleton and    }
muscle. Only small amounts of copper are typically stored in the body, and the average adult has a total body content of 50–120 mg copper.                                          }
:COPPER DEFICIENCY:
Copper deficiency is uncommon in humans. Based on studies in animals and      }
humans, the effects of copper deficiency include anemia, hypopigmentation,    }
hypercholesterolemia, connective tissue disorders, osteoporosis and other     }
bone defects, abnormal lipid metabolism, ataxia, and increased risk of        }
infection. Typical diets in the United States meet or exceed the copper RDA.  }
Two diseases in which copper might play a role are cardiovascular disease     }
(CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease.                                                }
                                                                              }
Some experts believe that dietary copper deficiency plays a role in the       }
etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of     }
dementia, because of several reports of low copper levels and low activity    }
of copper-dependent enzymes in the brains of people with the disease.         }
The evidence for this link is limited.                                        }
