Fluoride
:BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
Fluoride, a mineral, is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. Fluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine, and it inhibits or reverses the  }
initiation and progression of dental caries (tooth decay) and stimulates new bone formation. Soil, water, plants, and foods contain trace amounts of fluoride. Most of the fluoride }
that people consume comes from fluoridated water, foods and beverages prepared with fluoridated water, and toothpaste and other dental products containing fluoride. Approximately  }
80% or more of orally ingested fluoride is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. In adults, about 50% of absorbed fluoride is retained, and bones and teeth store about 99% of    }
fluoride in the body. The other 50% is excreted in urine. In young children, up to 80% of absorbed fluoride is retained because more is taken up by bones and teeth than in adults. }
Individual fluoride status is not typically assessed, although fluoride concentrations can be measured in plasma, saliva, urine, bones, nails, hair, and teeth. Criteria for        }
adequate, high, or low levels of fluoride in the body have not been established.                                                                                                    }
:EXCESSIVE FLUORIDE:
High doses of fluoride (typically from rare accidents resulting in excessively}
 high levels of fluoridation of water, unintentional ingestion of fluoride    }
products intended for topical use in dentists’ offices, or fluoride           }
supplements inappropriately given to children) can result in nausea, vomiting,}
abdominal pain, diarrhea, periostitis, and even death in rare cases.          }
Long-term ingestion of excess fluoride in infancy and childhood, when the     }
teeth are being formed, can lead to dental fluorosis. The characteristics of  }
this chronic condition usually vary from almost imperceptible white lines or  }
flecks to white or brown stains on teeth. Severe dental fluorosis can lead to }
pitting in tooth enamel. The risk of dental fluorosis increases with fluoride }
intakes above recommended amounts. Severe enamel fluorosis is very rare, and  }
no evidence indicates that recommended levels of community water fluoridation }
lead to severe dental fluorosis.                                              }
